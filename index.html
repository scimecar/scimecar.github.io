    <h4>My name is Mr. Ralph S Scimeca, a Computer Science Educator</h4>
    
        
    <p>I became a teacher to empower students to become creators. </p>
        
        <p>My individual teaching style focuses on:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Project based problem-solving, </li>
            <li>self-expression, </li>
            <li >and effective reflection. </li>

        i aim to foster self-awareness and student ownership in education.

over the past 8 years, i have successfully integrated various high-yield learning strategies, 
including diverse forms of expression, differentiation, social-emotional awareness, and engaging 
project-based learning. these strategies cater to the needs of every student in our classroom.

my firm commitment revolves around equipping students with essential tools and knowledge. 
i strive to establish an inclusive, dynamic learning environment that sparks the growth of a new 
generation of compassionate innovators in the exciting realm of computer science.</p>
