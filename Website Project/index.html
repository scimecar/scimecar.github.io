            <li>Project based learning,</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Research shows our learning and application 
                    of concepts strengthens 
                    as we construct real-world solutions</li>

            </ul>
            <li>Problem-solving, </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer Science at its core is focused on solving problems. 
                    As computer scientists we utilize 
                    <span class="ul">Computational Thinking</span> 
                    to help develop a framework of how to solve problems</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Self-expression, </li>
            <ul>
                <li>As technology integrates into all our lives, 
                    we have a responsibility to develop physical or virtual
                    environments for expression
                    and inclusion. Technology should extend our capabilities 
                    and therefore understanding how we can better use our computers to 
                become better versions of ourselves.</li>
            </ul>
            <li >and reflection. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Our access to a wide variety of resources can become crippling as 
                    resources compete for our attention. Effective computer scientists reflect
                    on their role, management of time and overall goal. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol> 

        <p> My firm commitment revolves around equipping students with 
            essential tools and knowledge. i strive to establish an inclusive, 
            dynamic learning environment that sparks the growth of a new 
            generation of compassionate innovators in the exciting realm of 
            computer science.</p>
